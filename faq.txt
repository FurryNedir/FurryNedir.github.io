	<div class="faqText"><h2>What's up with the costumes?</h2>
	<p>Fursuits are just one small part of the furry community, and only about <span class="furrydata unloadedData">activity: owned fursuit</span> of furries own one.</p>
	<p>Furries who fursuit do it for <a href="#fursuit">a variety of reasons</a>, but most of those reasons are just about letting loose, having fun, and making people happy.</p>

	<div class="faqText"><h2>Why does it seem like many furries are gay?</h2>
	<p>The furry community is one that prides itself on being open, inviting, and accepting.</p>
	<p>Because of this, many LGBT people who feel out of place in the mainstream world see the furry community as a safe place - somewhere that allows them to be who they really are.</p>
	<p>In many instances, this feeling of security and acceptance causes people to form a strong, positive association between the furry community and their sexuality.</p>

	<div class="faqText"><h2>Are furries zoophiles?</h2>
	<p>No. Zoophilia is completely unrelated to the furry community.</p>
	<p>One of the core characteristics of the furry community - including the adult portion of the community - is an appreciation for animals who are <span style="font-weight: bold">anthropomorphized</span>, which means they can think, speak, consent, and <span style="font-style: italic">look</span> like humans.</p>
	<p>Real animals are not capable of thought, speech, or consent on the same level as humans. More importantly, real animals do not look human in any way, so they are not sexually attractive to most furries.</p>

	<div class="faqText"><h2>Who made this site, and what's your angle?</h2>
	<p>Howdy! I'm a furry from the Midwest who makes furry content for a living.</p>
	<p>I made this site because when you google "what are furries?", the top results are a boring wikipedia page and a bunch of sensationalist news articles. I wanted to change that.</p>
	<p>For most furries, being a furry is a private, silly thing, not a big part of their identity. But some furries feel the need to "come out" as furries, and others are "outed" accidentally. I wanted to make a resource that those people could use to try to explain the whole "furry" thing to others.</p>

	<div class="faqText"><h2>How was this data collected?</h2>
	<p>The surveys used to build this website were posted on several online furry communities, by fairly prominent members of those communities. The surveys can also be taken by anyone who visits this page.</p>
	<p>Most of the survey responses come from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/furry/">/r/furry/</a>, a furry community with about 34,000 members.</p>
	<p>The remaining survey responses were collected on furry art websites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.furaffinity.net/">FurAffinity</a>. Because these websites often allow adult art, the survey results may be slightly skewed in favor of sex-positive answers.</p>
	<p>It's important to remember that, like any other survey, the numbers shown on this website only represent a small portion of the furry community. Furries with strong opinions and a high degree of activity within the community are more likely to take voluntary surveys.</p>

	<div class="faqText"><h2>I know someone who likes animated movies / animal races in video games. Are they a furry?</h2>
	<p>Probably not, but maybe!</p>
	<p>In the same way that it's possible to enjoy Star Trek without being a "trekkie," there are a lot of people who enjoy animated movies and animal races, but don't consider themselves furries.</p>
