		<p>To an outsider, furries often seem confusing and weird. It's a big community, and even furries have a hard time trying to explain it all.</p>
		<p>But since you're here, why not dig in a little bit?</p>
		<div style="display: block; height: 50px;"></div>
		<p>If you were sent here by a furry, try asking what <a href="#types">type of furry</a> they are.</p>
		<p>If you're a worried parent, take a look at the <a href="#sex">"Is it a sex thing?"</a> section, so you can learn what's going on, and what to watch out for.</p>
		<p>And if you're here because you're a furry, please <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/t7XkFHbZVAEWga6P2">take the survey</a> and <a href="mailto:feedback@whatarefurries.com">let us know</a> what you think about this page. Is it useful? Is it correct?</p>
